## Steps Taken

1. **Dashboard Creation**: We began by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and designed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard. Interactive visualizations and filtering capabilities were added to enable users to explore the data at various levels of granularity.

2. **Data Analysis**: Through data analysis, we provided valuable insights to the business entities, shedding light on the effectiveness of their sales strategies. This was accomplished through the creation of informative visualizations and charts.

3. **Sales Forecasting**: Leveraging historical data, we applied time series analysis techniques to generate sales forecasts for the next 15 days. This proactive approach allows the business to plan effectively and optimize operations.

4. **Actionable Insights and Recommendations**: The ultimate goal of this project is to share valuable insights and actionable information. These insights can drive strategic decision-making, supporting the supermarket's objectives for growth, efficiency, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

By following these steps, we aim to empower the business with data-driven decision-making capabilities and contribute to its ongoing success.
